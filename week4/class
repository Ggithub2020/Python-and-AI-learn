<!-- 🔍 When Do We Use Classes in Real-Life Scenarios?
We use classes in programming when we want to model real-world things or concepts that:

Have data (properties/attributes)

Can perform actions (methods/functions)

This approach is called Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Below are some common real-life scenarios where using classes is ideal:

✅ 1. School Management System
Class: Student, Teacher, Course, School

Why? Each entity has properties (e.g., name, grade, ID) and behaviors (e.g., register, teach, enroll).

✅ 2. E-Commerce Website
Class: Product, User, ShoppingCart, Order

Why? A Product has name, price, stock; a User can add to cart, place an order.

✅ 3. Banking System
Class: Account, Customer, Transaction

Why? An Account has a balance, and methods like deposit and withdraw.

✅ 4. Hospital Management
Class: Patient, Doctor, Appointment, MedicalRecord

Why? Each has clear data and actions (schedule, diagnose, treat, etc.).

✅ 5. Video Game Development
Class: Player, Enemy, Weapon, Level

Why? Characters and items need behaviors and states (e.g., health, damage, movement).

✅ 6. Transportation System
Class: Vehicle, Bus, Driver, Route

Why? A Bus has a capacity, route, driver, and actions like drive or stop.

✅ 7. Library System
Class: Book, Member, Loan

Why? A Book has a title and availability; a Member can borrow and return books.

🔧 Why Use Classes?
Organizes code around real things.

Encourages code reuse (using the same class to create many objects).

Makes large programs easier to manage.

Helps with modular and scalable systems.
