Summary
This script demonstrates basic face detection using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade classifier.

It loads an image, detects faces, draws rectangles around them, and displays the result.

It requires the image file face.jpg to be available in the working directory.

OpenCV handles the complex image processing and machine learning model inference behind the scenes.
