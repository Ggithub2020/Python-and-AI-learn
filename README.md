# Python and AI – Personal Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Python and AI Learning Repository** – a collection of materials, practice files, and notes based on the courses I’m taking (including content from Yayobe and other sources) to build my skills in Python programming and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## 📘 About This Repository

This space is a reflection of my self-paced learning path in **Python Programming and Artificial Intelligence**. I'm organizing all the exercises, lessons, practice projects, and resources I’ve worked on as I progress from beginner to more advanced topics.

### 🎯 Topics Covered
- Python fundamentals: variables, loops, functions, and data structures
- File handling, working with databases, and using modules
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
- Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Mini-projects and hands-on exercises:
  - Text and logic practice
  - Database operations
  - Classification models using real-world datasets

By organizing everything here, I can track my progress and revisit concepts as needed.
